        	<h3>Challenge</h3>
        	  <p>International Airports are home to millions of passengers and staff every single year.
        	  	Technology is becoming more vital to International Airports for the improvement of customer experience. The idea of autonomy is frequently explored and our team saw the potential of implementing autonomous vehicle into the space. Through our initial research we discovered that there was a strong need for a better quality and a more unified system in place to improve the overall experience for both passengers and staff. 
        	    We found that out of the people we interviewed, 78% had a negative experience at an international airport. The main problem area they struggled with were way finding, security and notifications. </p>

        	<h3>Design With Purpose</h3>
        	  <p id="exception"> How can passengers be given more control and information without staff assistance?
        	  	We needed to create UI design of an autonomous vehicle that aimed to solve the three main pain points but also it needed to consider the different use cases our stakeholders could experience: <br>
        	  	<br> &nbsp; - Travellers to be able to navigate around the airport without having to feel patronised by asking staff for help.
        	  	<br> &nbsp; - Travellers want to be  ‘in the know’ - delays are easier to accept when justified and alternatives are given.
        	  	<br> &nbsp; - Travellers wished their belongings to be secured and wanted to be entertained in cases of long waiting periods.
        	  </p>

        	<p>
        	    It was vital for us to come up with a considered design that would meet the user needs. It needed to be useful, user-friendly and efficient but also possibly be considered for use in places beyond our problem area.

        	  <p> With the purpose in mind the project began with an immense amount of conceptualisation. We explored and came up with range of concepts which we executed them with its possibilities and limitations. Next with the final chosen idea we created storyboards to imagine our idea taking place in a scenario case. It was key visual guide in getting our main ideas across without having to go into specific illustrations. <br>

        	<h3>Get The Story On Boards</h3>
        	  <p> With the story and scenario in mind we sketched out multiple iteration of interface design and content ideas by annotating important elements we considered. We constantly reflected back to the user pain points and reasoned every feature we implemented into our interface design to make sure we met the user needs. The annotated sketches which developed into paper prototypes were tested on potential users within our target stakeholders range. This stage was vital as it helped us to fix and take out any issues from an early stage. Going forward we knew that any changes made during our iteration process was heavily referenced back to the user testing. It was a key visual guide to analyse the design ideas reflecting on its usefulness and usability before entering the wire framing stage. <br>

<!-- Decision Making -->
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
        	<h3>Decision Making</h3>
        	  <p id="exception"> The iterative process allowed the team to reduce usability issues and was closer to meeting our goal to ensure a good user experience. These were the important changes that impacted greatly with the user user interacting with the Friendbot: <br>
        	  <br> &nbsp; <b> 1. Language Selection </b>
        	  <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The initial layout of including language option on the navigation bar was completely ignored and was behind in the hierarchy of importance in the design layout. The ability to select their preferred language at the start before beginning the journey was highly valued by users. This change was an important functionality that improved customer’s experience. <br>
        	  <br> &nbsp; <b> 2. Buzzer </b>
        	  <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Assurance of security for the food and item delivery was vital so that the user would use this feature worry-free. To solve this issue we decided to incorporate a ‘buzzer’ which the user takes while the Friendbot collects their purchases. The “buzzer” acts as a GPS for the Friendbot to track back to their user and for the user then to insert the buzzer back in to the correct Friendbot to unlock and collect their purchases. <br>
        	  <br> &nbsp; <b> 3. Error Prevention </b>
        	  <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Annoyance and structural problem occurred when including back buttons on each page, however it still required a way for the user to undo or go back to the previous screen for different scenario case as well as to reduce error prevention. We introduced swipe functionality (right swipe) which allowed users to have more control and to familiarise with this behaviour we included a short animation that would instruct the user. <br>
        	  <br> &nbsp; <b> 4. Delay Notifications </b>
        	  <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Initially we introduced the alert button which allowed the user to check the important announcement if they wished to. However alerts about any flight details and change were vital to customers. Hence we introduced a ‘pop up’ notification on the screen that will alert the user with any flight details and changes with real time data so that the user does not miss any important announcements. This change was necessary as the alert button was completely ignored during the user testing stages. <br>
        	  </p>

        	  <p>This stage was vital as for our next stage. We were able to decide on the style and component guide that would be based on and would meet the changes in content and structure of the design as well as to enhance the existing content with positive user feedback.</p>

<!-- Considered style decisions -->

        <div class="col-md-6">
        	<h3 id="StyleSection">Considered style decisions</h3>
        	  <p> The goal for the design was to create minimalistic and simple yet modern layout with the use of simple shapes. We wanted to create a more human-oriented design which was achieved with the use of universally recognised and symbolised colours. The use of the blue tone colour scheme was to represent sky. We wanted the primary colour theme to match the environment of the international airport space. By using repeated components, shapes and colour led to success in user-friendliness of the product. The use of red tone colour scheme was chosen for important notifications. <br>

<!-- Designing final versions of screens-->

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3>Final stage of screens</h3>
            <p>After the decision of the style and component guide we brought those elements into our design of the final versions of screens. The goal of the interaction part of the design was to make it simple and easy to navigate around the screens for different age groups, from those of the younger and older generations. We used elements such as swipe and tap to meet our minimalistic design and for a simple user journey that allowed the human brain to absorb. It led users to an enjoyable journey across the different screens which also enhanced the overall customer experience.</p>
