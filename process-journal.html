One day we shared our experiences about travelling interstate and overseas. It sparked our minds in wanting to explore the international airport. This process made me to understand the importance in communication and working in teams.

                The use of research plan helped us to plan out our research as well allowing us to apply critical thinking into the process. We used research questions to make sure our research would discover the key questions we wish to research:

                <p>This method was interesting approach to research the problem area as I was able to observe something that I would have not have noticed. It allows to understand the quality of the space, which areas are being neglected. It was interesting to see from a spectator’s view to the entire area. However saying that it also had its limitations as it did not provide user’s opinions to the space and products provided by the airport. With this in mind I tried to overcome the challenge by using another research method.</p>

                  <li>The goal in the development of the application should be focused on the decrease in time taken for each of the stages of the departure process to boarding, clearer wayfinding, enhanced technology in reliability and added and improved service to ensure customer’s experience at the airport.</li>
                  <li>The next steps of this is to be working with the core stakeholders such as frequent travellers, families, young adults, etc. to make sure we we can improve the overall quality of the customer’s experience at the airport. User testing, iteration of prototypes, walk throughs will be implemented to improve our goal in ensuring and improving customer experience and operational efficiency.</li>

              <h4>Reflection</h4>
              <p>The concepts were all good starting points, however they lacked depth and was not well thought out. The ideas needed to be backed up clearly with pain points from research. Rather than jumping straight to an idea, we started writing a problem statement and chose areas (top three pain points/issues) within the research we previously had done and used the “how-might-we” question as a method to allow critical thinking. Further on we answered the questions to guide us what our newly developed ideas should be based on.</p>

<h3>Stage 2: Developing Stage of User needs</h3>
             <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-6">
               <h4>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h4>
                <p>The Sydney International Airport is a public space that aims to provide fast and efficient service to its yearly 14.9 million passengers. They strive to create a “more informed journey through technology”, however, our primary research has found that these services are insufficient and tend to result in negative customer experiences. We discovered through user research that the Sydney International Airport needs to focus on improving service for travellers in the three main areas of wayfinding, providing updates to customers and security.</p>

          </div>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>From our initial research, we discovered a range of issues that our users were experiencing. From these key problems, the following user needs became clear:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Travellers want to be able to navigate around the airport without having to feel patronised by asking staff for help</li>
                  <li>Staff need to be able to complete their required tasks without having to be interrupted by travellers questions that can be avoided.</li>
                  <li>Travellers want to be ‘in the know’ - delays are easier to accept when justified and alternatives are given.</li>
                </ul>
              <br>
            </div>
          </div>
            

<h3>Stage 3: Developing Initial Concepts</h3>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>As a team we developed three initial concepts with more thoughts. For each concept we considered what each concept does, how it works, the target audience, the problem area the concept tackles, exploration of the journey of the concept with the use of storyboard and possible interface screen ideas. We were able to receive more specific and more valuable feedback to our initial concepts allowing for an in-depth process of iteration of the concepts.</p>

                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                 <p>During the process of redeveloping of initial concepts and through the feedback of the user we had to identify the reasons for the different features we implemented in the initial concepts. Through the process of identifying the reasons for the features allowed us to reflect back on the user needs and whether they have been met by our ideas of the feature implemented in our concepts.

                 <p>The two versions of the FriendBot was originally intended to pass as two separate interfaces however as we tested with our tutor, due to the similarities in both the interface and end goals, these two versions were combined to create a final, combined version of the autonomous robot.</p>
                 <ul>
                  <h5>The Sleep Function</h5><li><p>The sleep feature was integrated into the final concept as it gave the user the freedom to use the functionality and services that the bot provides at their own leisure.</p></li>
                  <h5>Passport Data</h5><li><p>Uses the data from the passport that is already implemented in the face scanning technology of the airport, to recognise the user and be able to provide services personalised to them and others in their group.</p></li>
                  <h5>Trahcking Device</h5><li><p>Uses a type of tracking device buzzer that facilitates the bot in finding the user to deliver their purchases, no matter where the user walks or travels.</p></li>
                 </ul>
                <p>We established 10 characteristics that we found were important to our users through our original research. We used decision matrices to compare our concepts to this criteria to determine which two of our concepts were the most appropriate. The making of design matrices allowed us to constantly be reminded of the user needs we are trying to meet. Also, through the use of design matrices it helped us to evaluate the concept and to understand which concepts have met the user needs the most.</p>

              <h4>Reflection</h4>
               <p>After taking into consideration our decision matrices we initially came to the conclusion to do two concepts for the Friendbot idea. However, after realising the similarity between the interfaces and structure for both ideas, we decided to refresh and revamp one of our initial concepts. We went back to our sketches and analysed the decision matrices again and decided as a group that naviGATE would be the more suitable pick. From there, we created another round of sketches and paper prototypes  for each concept and tested them on a range of users.</p>

The same process was applied for the third concept: Friendbot.</p>

      <p>Although the think aloud method can be a powerful tool, we chose to do this in tandem with observation so that we could ensure that what the user was doing matched with what the user was saying. We watched their behaviour for any signs of confusion, hesitation, and/or unclear to get the most accurate results from our user testing.</p>

      <p>We also used the method of a semi-structured interview to be able to gain some qualitative and quantitative data from our users. We asked a few specific questions at the end of each test, but also we asked questions throughout the test  based on users’ actions and words. At time we asked for clarification and at others we prompted them to say how they felt about an element of the interface. </p>

               <p>The wireframing process allowed us to see a closer look to the finished prototype. It also helped us to receive more valuable and specific feedbacks from user testing with the wireframes linked with an interactive prototype tool such as invision. The wireframing process also allowed us to decide which content we wanted to prioritise, how we wanted to display the content on each screen and how we wanted to structure the content on every screen. We needed a strong skeleton base of the screens to implement style and functionality to the screens.</p>

               <p>The user testing allowed us to identify areas we did not see as a problem allowed room for opportunities. It also inspired ideas for solution to the user’s struggle and confusion during the user testing process. A designer can not only conclude their ideas with designing their concept but need to make sure they meet the users problem. This process helped us gain valuable insights as to why and how they used our interface. The preparation of user testing also helped us to better understand and reflect upon who our target audience were and what we wished for the user to achieve through our autonomous vehicle.</p>

                <p>After going through two rounds of user testing, once with paper prototypes and a second time with medium-fidelity wireframes, we had ample feedback and direction to begin the next fidelity of prototyping. We gathered quite positive feedback from our users with only a few small aspects that needed to be changed and enhanced when moving forward with the interactive prototype.</p>
                <p>As a team we decided how we wished for the prototype to look like in terms of aesthetic elements as we have already structered the main architecture through wireframes. As a team we decided to implement material design to the aesthetics as it allowed the functionalities to be clear. Buttons became more clearer in their role of indication through material design.</p>

              <div class="col-md-10">
                <p>When testing our interactive prototypes, we decided to keep a similar structure and approach to our testing of both the paper prototypes and the medium fidelity wireframes. We decided to only do one round of testing for the interactive prototypes because of time restrictions and also the fact that our user testers for the wireframes had very few changes issues. For us, this was a good sign that the concept and usability of the FriendBot interfaces were intuitive.</p>
                <p>User testing was an important next step in the prototyping and testing stages on the design process. We needed to see how our potential users would interact and engage with our interactive prototype as it would be the closest to the final product as we can get it at this stage.</p>
              </div>

          <div class="col-md-12">
            <h4>User testing (Method)</h4>
             <p>For our user testing of the interactive prototype, we decided to employ three different types methods to get the most relevant and rich set of data that we could. These three methods were used in conjunction and helped support and validate each other.</p>

              <div class="row">

          <br>
             <p>We also decided to utilise the think-aloud method so that we could get a better understanding of our users' thoughts whilst they were performing the tasks we put forward to them. The think-aloud method was good in getting a direct insight into what our users were thinking when they were interacting with our interactive prototype so we could easily tell where points of confusion where and the aspects which they liked.</p>
              <p>However, when using the think-aloud method for user testing, it's important to remember that people not always say what they actually think. Therefore we did not solely rely on this method for our user testing research but rather used it in tandem with other methods to support each other and make our findings more valid.</p> 
              <p>To record our think-aloud findings, we either recorded the session or took notes of the key points the user expressed. We then sifted through the data and organised it into categories of what our users thought was helpful, what was confusing and what was lacking.</p>
        </div>
  <div class="tab-pane" id="method5" role="tabpanel">
    <br>
      <p>Although the think aloud method can be a powerful tool, we chose to do this in tandem with observation so that we could ensure that what the user was doing matched with what the user was saying. We watched their behaviour for any signs of confusion, hesitation, and/or unclear to get the most accurate results from our user testing.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="tab-pane" id="method6" role="tabpanel">
    <br>
      <p>We decided to conduct semi-structured interviews during and after our user testing sessions. We wanted to conduct interviews as it would be a good foundation to get qualitative data from our users so from there, we could extract user needs and frustrations. However, the very structured and organised formation of interviews meant that we wouldn't be able to ask our users questions based on their words and actions. Therefore, we decided that the a semi-structure interview would best suit the function of user testing. We often asked our users more probing or explanatory questions based on the feedback and thoughts they gave us. This was followed by a few set questions to get some concrete quanitative data but also qualtitative data based on users' experiences.</p>
      <p>At the end of each user testing session, we asked the following questions to gather specific data:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>How would you rate the usability on a scale of 1-5? How easy was it to use?</li>
      <li>Would you actually use this product in a foreign airport and/or local airport?</li>
      <li>Would you use the product to find your way or for the other services it provides?</li>
      <li>Were the notifications regarding boarding times helpful in deciding how to spend your time?</li>
      <li>5. Did you find the interactions within the prototype (swipes to go back for example) intuitive?</li>
    </ol>

             <h5>WHO DID WE CONDUCT OUR SESSIONS WITH?</h5>
             <p>Gathering and testing on appropriate users is a very important aspect of conducting user research sessions. Our target audience for FriendBot could be considered quite diverse. We wanted this concept to be valuable for people of all ages and in all different situations. Our core stakeholders included:</p>

             <p>After receiving the feedback from our first round of testing, our next steps in the prototyping and testing stage became evident. We would have to try to address the points of confusion that our users experienced as well as improve the usability of some aspects within the prototype. We made these few changes to the interactive prototype so that we could test a final improved version to a few more users.</p>
             <ol>
               <li style="font-size: 25px"><b>Red Notificaiton</b></li><p><b>PROBLEM:</b> Our users did not realise the itinerary button change colours or noticed and didn't realise it's importance.</p>
               <p><b>SOLUTION:</b> Our solution to this problem was to introduce a pop-up notification screen instead. This could pop-up at any time, depending on when the information becomes released. The user must acknowledge the notification to close it which ensures they read it before continuing their activity. However, if for some reason they want to revisit the notification, the red alert will remain alert to remind the user that there is some sort of delay.</p>
               <li style="font-size: 25px"><b>Back Button</b></li><p><b>PROBLEM:</b> There was no back buttons so that users could have freedom when interacting with the FriendBot.</p> 
               <p><b>SOLUTION:</b> Our solution to this problem was to introduce a swipe functionality to the FriendBot where all the user has to do is swipe right to be taken to the previous page. Majority of our users preferred having a the swipe functionality over a button due to the vast presence of this type of functionality in many touch screen interactions such as Facebook. This however, brought up an issue about how the user would know that they could swipe to go back, unless they experimented or accidentally did it. Therefore, we introduced a new screen after the language selection page that would briefly show the user how to swipe. Unfortunately, FramerX, the prototyping tool we used was unable to provide this functionality in our interactive prototypes.</p>
             </ol>
             <p>To move forward in the design process, we made the above changes and did two more user testing sessions to get a general idea of how this increased usability and whether there was any other hidden issues with our interactive prototype.</p>

            <h3>Stage 6: Justification (Round 2)</h3>
            <h4>JUSTIFICATION (ROUND 2)</h4>
             <p>After incorporting the feedback from the first round of testing, the users from round two had a very positive experience with our interactive prototype. All the major issues had been addressed and our users found it easy to navigate through the interface to achieve their tasks and also browse a little through the available screens. There was only one potential issue that was identified in this final round of user testing.</p>
             <ol>
               <li style="font-size: 25px"><b>Menu Button</b></li><p><b>PROBLEM:</b>One of our users was wondering if there was a more efficient way to get back to the menu rather then just continuously swipping back.</p>
                <p><b>SOLUTION:</b> Our solution to this problem is to introduce another swipe function where the user can swipe down on the screen to pull down a few options. On this screen the user can either go to the "Main Menu" that has all the buttons for the services the bot provides, and also there will be a "End Journey" button so that the user can easily terminate their journey at any point after you have reached your gate. To make the user aware as to how this swipe function would work, a new screen will be implemented before the menu screen which will show a short animation.</p>
             </ol>
             <p>To move forward in the design process, we made the above changes and did two more user testing sessions to get a general idea of how this increased usability and whether there was any other hidden issues with our interactive prototype.</p>

                <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
                <p>The interactive prototype not only allowed us to visualise the aesthettic look of our final design but is also helped the team to understand and comprehend better to who we are designing for, what we are designing and why we are designing. Due to the strong basis early stages of prototyping, it allowed us to visualise our final product better. For understanding the exact needs and expectations of our stakeholders an interactive prototype is crucial.</p>

                <p>Through the makings of user journey walkthrough of the screens allowed us to review the screens and test the interfaces ourselves. During most of the design process we were more focused on developing and iterating the concept and did not have a chance to user test ourselves as users. It allowed me to reflect back on our design and what it was trying to achieve.</p>
